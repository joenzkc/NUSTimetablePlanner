## General Information

As a student, we often face difficulty planning our timetables because we are given too many options to choose from. This leads to a lot of decision fatigue and unnecessary stress during our first few weeks of module registration. This inspired us to come up with a simple web application to help us preplan our timetables, so that we do not need to sieve through the hundreds of different options to come up with an ideal timetable.

## Technologies

Our tech stack consists of:

- React-JS
- HTML / CSS
- MongoDB
- NUSMods API
